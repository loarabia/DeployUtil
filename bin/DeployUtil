""" CommandLine Tool for using DeployUtil's services.

This module provides a commandline interface for DeployUtil which is a module
that uses the Windows 10 Windows Device Portal REST APIs to perform common
developer operations on Universal Windows Applications.

DeployUtil can perform the following commands:

	pair		use a pin to pair a PC to a target 
	list		list the UWPs installed on the target 
	install		install a new UWP and its dependencies on the target 
	uninstall 	uninstall a UWP on a target 
	launch		launch a UWP on the target

Note: 
 UWP 	is short hand to refer to a Universal Windows Application.
 target is any device running the Windows Device Portal. This could also be
	the localhost


pair
----

Authenticates the PC running deployutil with the target device and stores a
cookie on disk to avoid having to reauthenticate.

Example: 
	./deployutil pair -pin 1A2b3c

The Windows Device Portal requires authentication by default. This is generally
a good thing(TM) because WDP provides someone with the ability to remotely
shutdown/reboot a device, launch apps on it, stop apps on it, install apps on
it, or generally be obnoxious. 

It is possible to disable WDP's authenticator but this should only be done in
trustworthy environments with a minimum of trolls in the surrounding areas.
 
Pairing like you would a Bluetooth device is used by WDP to authenticate. It
also returns a cookie to ensure future requests don't have to reauthenticate
for every request.

If you do disable the authenticator, you can ignore this command.

Cookies are stored on disk next to deployutil


list
----

Lists the installed applications as a json object.

Examples:
	./deployutil list
	./deployutil list -pretty

The list command returns the list of all installed applications and metadata 
about them as a string of JSON data. It takes on optional argument -pretty 
which will pretty print the JSON objects to be more human readable.


install
-------

Installs the application and any application dependencies.

Examples:
	./deployutil install My.appx -depsdir ./MY_APPX_Dependencies/


uninstall
---------

Uninstalls the application.

Example:
	./deployutil uninstall My.Namespace.App_1.1.0.0_en_us_daf314adf


launch
------

Uninstalls the application.

Example:
	./deployutil launch My.Namespace.App_1.1.0.0_en_us_daf314adf
